This project is a Next.js + assistant-ui chatbot widget with a floating launcher, animated open and close transitions, and Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite as the model provider.

Built on top of the [assistant-ui](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui) starter.

## Features

- Floating assistant launcher button
- Animated open and close modal transitions
- Chat thread UI using assistant-ui primitives
- Gemini model integration through AI SDK
- Ready to deploy on Vercel

## Environment Variables

Set at least one of these variables in local or hosted environments:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The API route at app/api/chat/route.ts accepts either variable and uses gemini-2.5-flash-lite.

Optional typing speed control:

```
CHAT_STREAM_DELAY_MS=28
```

Higher value = slower typing effect. Lower value = faster rendering.

Optional Sona Star website CTA link (used when users need official follow-up details):

```
SONA_STAR_WEBSITE_URL=https://your-sona-star-website.com
```

When configured, the assistant can include a clickable markdown link in relevant replies:

`[Visit Sona Star Website](https://your-sona-star-website.com)`
